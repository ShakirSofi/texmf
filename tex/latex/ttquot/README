% ttquot.sty
%
% This style is intended to make it easier to write text on technical
% subjects, so that the text is readable even when it is TeX source.
%
% One of the most common problems is switching conveniently into the
% typewriter font and back. This style file makes the ordinary double
% quotation mark (") serve this function. Note that the meaning of \tt
% may be different in math and text mode, for example if the "times"
% package is being used.
%
% This package also makes underscore characters (_) switch into
% emphasized mode and back, unless inside " quotes or in math mode. This
% makes ordinary variable names easier to type in typewriter font, and
% makes emphasized mode obey a common ASCII text convention.
%
% Options:
%   sfcode
%       Makes text inside quotation marks come out in \sf font.
%   small
%       Makes text inside quotation marks come out \small (except in math
%       mode.) This is especially useful when using the times package, because
%       the Courier and Helvetica fonts are larger than Times.
%   stdbraces
%       By default, the commands \{ and \} emit ordinary characters 123 and
%       125 inside quotation marks. This works well if you are in \tt font,
%       but not so well in a font (e.g., \sf) lacking these characters. Use
%       stdbraces to defeat it.
%   bfemph
%       Make underscore turn on boldface instead of italics.
%
% The following macros are defined and may be used or overridden.
%
% \ttquot@activate       Turn on ttquot processing. On by default.
% \ttquot@deactivate     Turn off ttquot processing.
% \ttquot@ttmode         The 'code' environment introduced by "
% \ttquot@emmode         The 'emphasized' environment introduced by _
% \ttquot@setup          Commands that are emitted in the " environment.
% \ttquot@ttfont         The font part of tt@setup, By default, \tt.
% \ttquot@ttsize         The font size part of tt@setup, By default, nothing.
% \ttquot@emfont         The commands that are emitted in the _ environment.
%                        By default, \em
% \ttquot@braces         Another command emitted in the " environment.
%                        By default, changes braces to use tt font chars.
%                        The "stdbraces" option defeats this.
% \ttquot@mark           Always represents the plain character (")
% \ttquot@us             Represents the original meaning of (_)
